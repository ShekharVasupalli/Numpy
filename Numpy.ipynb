    "Q2)  Compare and contrast np.mean() and np.average() functions in NumPy. When would you use one over the  other?\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans) In NumPy, both np.mean() and np.average() are used to compute the central tendency of an array, but they differ in their behavior and applications. Here's a comparison:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Basic Difference:\n",
    "np.mean():\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Computes the arithmetic mean (average) of the array elements.\n",

    "Usage: Use when you need a simple mean calculation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "np.average():\n",
    "\n",
    "Purpose: Computes a weighted average of the array elements.\n",
    "Weights: Accepts an optional weights parameter, which allows each element to contribute differently to the result.\n",
    "Usage: Use when you need to calculate a weighted mean or when you want more control over how elements contribute to the average.\n",
    "\n",

    "Syntax: np.average(a, axis=None, weights=None, returned=False)\n",
    "Takes an additional weights parameter. If weights is not provided, it behaves the same as np.mean().\n",
    "Can return both the weighted average and the sum of weights if returned=True.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Weighted Average:\n",
    "np.mean(): Does not support weighting, so it computes the simple mean.\n",
    "np.average(): Supports weighting via the weights argument, allowing you to calculate a weighted average where some values have more influence than others.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Performance:\n",
    "When weights are not needed, np.mean() is slightly faster and more efficient because it doesnâ€™t involve additional computations for weights.\n",

    "''' Q3) Describe the methods for reversing a NumPy array along different axes. Provide examples for 1D and 2D  arrays.\n",
    "Ans) Reversing a NumPy array along different axes can be done using several methods that allow control over which axis is reversed, depending on \n",

    "\n",
    "1. Reversing Using Slicing ([::-1])\n",
    "Theory:\n",
    "Slicing in Python and NumPy allows selecting elements from an array or list with a specified step size. The slicing syntax [::-1] reverses the array \n",

    "Q4)  How can you determine the data type of elements in a NumPy array? Discuss the importance of data types in memory management and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ans) To determine the data type of elements in a NumPy array, you can use the following methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "dtype Attribute:\n",
    "\n",
    "The dtype attribute of a NumPy array provides the data type of the elements stored in the array.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "print(arr.dtype) \n",
    "\n",
    "np.array() and dtype Parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "When creating a NumPy array, you can explicitly set the data type using the dtype parameter. This is useful for controlling the data type and ensuring compatibility with specific numerical operations.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3], dtype=np.float64)\n",
    "print(arr.dtype)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "astype() Method:\n",
    "\n",
    "The astype() method can be used to convert the data type of the elements in the array to another type. This is also a way to examine and manipulate the data type of an array.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "arr = np.array([1.0, 2.0, 3.0])\n",
    "new_arr = arr.astype(int)\n",
    "print(new_arr.dtype)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of Data Types in NumPy\n",
    "1. Memory Management:\n",
    "Data types (or dtype in NumPy) define how much memory is allocated for each element of an array. Each data type specifies the size of the data in bytes, and choosing the correct data type has a significant impact on memory usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "Smaller data types save memory: For example, int8 (8-bit integer) uses 1 byte per element, while int64 (64-bit integer) uses 8 bytes per element. For large arrays, choosing a smaller data type can drastically reduce memory consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "Higher precision uses more memory: Data types like float64 (64-bit floating point) consume more memory than float32 (32-bit floating point). Using high precision where not necessary can lead to inefficient memory use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Efficient use of memory is critical in large datasets: When working with millions of data points (e.g., in machine learning or big data analytics), selecting the appropriate data type ensures that memory is used efficiently, preventing unnecessary memory allocation or memory overflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Performance Optimization:\n",
    "The data type of a NumPy array also impacts the performance of operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Faster computation with lower precision types: Operations involving lower precision data types (like int16 or float32) are faster because they require less computation and bandwidth compared to higher precision types (like int64 or float64). For tasks that do not need high precision, this leads to significant performance gains.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hardware-level optimization: NumPy arrays are implemented in C, and NumPy leverages low-level optimization (SIMD instructions) that is tuned to the array's data type. This allows NumPy to perform operations like element-wise addition, multiplication, and matrix transformations very quickly, especially when the data type matches the underlying hardware architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "Cache efficiency: Choosing smaller data types allows more elements to fit into the CPU cache, improving cache performance. This is critical when performing repeated operations on large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Numerical Precision:\n",
    "Data types also determine the precision of numerical operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision errors in floating-point operations: Using data types with lower precision (e.g., float32 vs. float64) can lead to rounding errors in numerical computations. In scientific computing, simulations, or machine learning tasks where numerical accuracy is paramount, using the appropriate data type ensures that calculations remain accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integer overflow/underflow: Choosing an integer data type that is too small (e.g., int8 or int16) can result in overflow or underflow if values exceed the range that the data type can store. Ensuring the right data type is crucial for avoiding these errors."

    "Q5)  Define ndarrays in NumPy and explain their key features. How do they differ from standard Python lists?\n",
    "Ans) What are ndarrays in NumPy?\n",
    "In NumPy, an ndarray (N-dimensional array) is the core data structure used to store and manipulate numerical data. It is a grid-like structure that holds items of the same data type, typically numbers, arranged in multiple dimensions. These arrays are homogeneous, meaning every element in the array must be of the same type, and they allow for fast and efficient numerical operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key Features of ndarrays\n",
    "Multidimensional Support:\n",
    "\n",
    "An ndarray can have any number of dimensions, from 1D (like a vector) to 2D (like a matrix), to higher dimensions (n-dimensional arrays).\n",
    "\n",
    "Homogeneous Data Types:\n",
    "\n",
    "All elements in an ndarray must have the same data type (e.g., int32, float64), ensuring memory efficiency and fast operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Memory Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "ndarrays are stored in contiguous blocks of memory, unlike Python lists which are arrays of pointers to objects. This makes them much more memory-efficient and faster to access.\n",
    "The dtype attribute specifies the data type of the array, which helps NumPy optimize memory use.\n",
    "Vectorized Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations on ndarrays are performed element-wise, without the need for explicit loops. This concept, known as vectorization, allows for fast and efficient computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Broadcasting:\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy allows arithmetic operations on arrays of different shapes, automatically \"broadcasting\" the smaller array over the larger array to make the operation compatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing and Indexing:\n",
    "\n",
    "ndarrays support advanced slicing and indexing, allowing you to efficiently select and manipulate specific elements, rows, columns, or sub-arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support for Mathematical Functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy provides a wide array of mathematical, statistical, and linear algebra functions that operate on ndarrays, making them a powerful tool for scientific computing and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shape and Size Attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "The shape attribute indicates the dimensions of the array (e.g., 2x3 for a 2D array with 2 rows and 3 columns).\n",
    "The size attribute provides the total number of elements in the array.\n",
    "\n",
    "How ndarrays Differ from Python Lists\n",
    "Memory Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python lists are collections of references to objects, meaning each element in a list is a pointer to an object stored elsewhere in memory. In contrast, ndarrays store elements in contiguous memory, which is far more efficient, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "NumPy arrays use less memory because the data is stored in a fixed type and in compact form.\n",
    "Homogeneity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Python lists can store elements of different data types (e.g., integers, floats, strings). ndarrays, however, require all elements to be of the same type, which allows NumPy to optimize storage and performance.\n",
    "Performance (Speed):\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to contiguous memory storage and vectorized operations, ndarrays are significantly faster than Python lists for numerical and mathematical computations. Python lists require explicit loops for such operations, which are slower.\n",
    "Vectorized Operations:\n",
    "\n",
    "Operations on NumPy arrays are applied element-wise without the need for looping (i.e., vectorized). Python lists require explicit loops to perform element-wise operations, which are slower and more complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy arrays can perform operations with arrays of different shapes through broadcasting, making mathematical operations flexible. Python lists don't support broadcasting and would require explicit loops to achieve the same result.\n",
    "Built-in Functions for Arrays:\n",
    "\n",
    "NumPy provides a vast collection of optimized mathematical, statistical, and algebraic functions that work directly on arrays, which Python lists do not support. For example, functions like np.sum(), np.mean(), and np.dot() make complex operations easy and efficient with ndarrays."

    "\n",
    "Ans) The array_split() method in NumPy is used to split an array into multiple sub-arrays. It is a flexible version of the split() method, especially useful when the array cannot be evenly divided.\n",
    "\n",
    "Functionality of array_split()\n",
    "Basic Use: It splits an array into a specified number of sub-arrays. You can define how many parts you want the array to be split into.\n",
    "Uneven Splits: If the array size is not divisible by the number of parts, array_split() will handle the remainder by distributing extra elements into some of the sub-arrays. The first sub-arrays will have one more element than the others to accommodate the unevenness.\n",
    "How It Handles Uneven Splits:\n",
    "When the number of elements in the array is not divisible by the number of splits:\n",

    "operations?\n",
    "Ans) Vectorization:\n",
    "Concept: Vectorization refers to performing operations directly on entire arrays (or vectors) without the need for explicit loops. In NumPy, operations like addition, multiplication, and other mathematical functions are applied element-wise to entire arrays at once.\n",
    "Benefit: It leverages low-level optimizations, making operations faster by eliminating Python loops and allowing NumPy to use highly efficient C-based implementations.\n",
    "Example: '''\n",
    "\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",

    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"____________________\")\n",
    "\n",
    "''' Broadcasting:\n",
    "Concept: Broadcasting allows NumPy to perform operations on arrays of different shapes by automatically expanding the smaller array to match the shape of the larger one. This enables operations without creating large temporary arrays, saving memory and computation time.\n",
    "Benefit: It simplifies code and allows for efficient computation on arrays with different dimensions.\n",
    "Example: '''\n",
    "\n",
    "arr = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])\n",
    "vec = np.array([1, 2, 3])\n",
    "result = arr + vec\n",
    "print(result)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "''' Contribution to Efficiency:\n",
    "Vectorization speeds up operations by using optimized internal code.\n",
    "Broadcasting reduces memory usage and simplifies computations by avoiding redundant data expansion.\n",
